Our work, ["IMUSteth: On-Body Stethoscope Localization with Inertial Sensing for Home Self-Screening"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3737901.3768363), was accepted and presented at the [IASA 2025](https://intelligent-acoustics.org/2025/) workshop, during [MobiCom 2025](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2025/). IASA 2025 is the premier workshop for all aspects of acoustic sensing, systems, and applications.

In this work, we extend our prior work on an [augmented reality-based stethoscope](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3583120.3586962), originally published to [IPSN 2023](https://ipsn.acm.org/2023/), that guides users on the steps to take to screen their own health without a professional healthcare provider. This requires the system to understand where the user placed the stethoscope on their body, which leveraged a full-body view from a camera. This is both unwieldy and privacy sensitive. 

In this work, we remove the need for the user to position themselves in front of a camera. Instead, we leverage only an inertial measurement unit, several physical characteristics of the user and an initial calibration phase (e.g., move arms in a circle) to track a user's placement of the stethoscope on their body. This enables more freedom on where and when the user can perform health screening, making accessibility to preventative health screening more available.

Congratulations to Yiting Zhang and the team!
