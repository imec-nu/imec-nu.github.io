We demonstrated our work ["EmbodiedRDA: Connecting Foundation Models with the Physical World using Reconfigurable Drone Agents"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3636534.3698846) and was awarded the Best Demo Runner-Up award at the 30th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking ([ACM MobiCom 2024](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2024/)) in Washington, DC.

EmbodiedRDA connects foundation models with the physical world through a custom-designed drone platform that autonomously reconfigures itself with different sensors and actuators depending on the task at hand. The system adapts to various tasks in physical environments – from locating objects to environmental monitoring and physical assistance.

Congratulations to Junxi Xia, Minghui Zhao, Kaiyuan Hou, and the rest of the team!
