["TRAMBA: A Hybrid Transformer and Mamba Architecture for Practical Audio and Bone Conduction Speech Super Resolution and Enhancement on Mobile and Wearable Platforms"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3699757) was accepted to Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT) and will be presented at [UbiComp / ISWC 2025](https://ubicomp.hosting.acm.org/ubicompiswc2025_wp/).

In this work, we present a novel architecture for enhancing speech on mobile and wearable platforms. This work bridges the gap speech enhancement quality from computationally heavy techniques (e.g., GANs) and the compute efficiency of lightweight techniques (e.g., U-Net). Congrats to Yueyuan Sui and the rest of the team!
