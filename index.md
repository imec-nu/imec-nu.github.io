# Intelligent Mobile and Embedded Computing Lab

At IMEC, we work at the intersection between systems, embedded AI, and data within the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). We develop resource-efficient and real-time systems that can embed intelligent perception, reasoning, and understanding into common infrastructure and everyday objects found all around us and utilize these systems in efficient ways to enable useful services and improve our overall quality of life. Our work spans a number of domains, including mobile and embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, edge computing, signal processing, machine learning, wearables, robotics, health, intelligent built environments, etc.
